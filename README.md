# STATS 220

This is my repo for **STATS 220**. If interested, you can find the course outline [here](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1253).



## A little about me

- I am from Lima, Peru
- I am undertaking a degree in *Psychology & Statistics*
- I am taking **STATS 220** because I want to get better at R



## I am interested in...

1. Conducting policy-relevant research
2. Learning about quantitative methods in psychology
3. Improving official statistics management and communication

For example, the "Search by Survey" function on the INEI's (Peruvian equivalent of Stats NZ) [microdata website](https://proyectos.inei.gob.pe/microdatos/) is currently broken, as the year/period does not show up when selecting a survey. This makes it more difficult to access what should be open data. I am interested in addressing these types of situations.
